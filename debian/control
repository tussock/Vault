Description: Backups For The Rest Of Us
 The Vault provides a simple set-and-forget backup management system.
 .
 It backups up files to a variety of media, and includes support for
 encryption out of the box, splitting, automatic storage management, 
 cloud based storage (DropBox, AmazonS3, with more to come),
 hash validation and more. It also includes a simple to use GUI to get
 you started right away.
 .
 All data is stored in industry standard TAR/GZIP compatible files, 
 and encrypted with OpenSSL encryption (AES-256). A variety of 
 disaster recovery systems are available in case the worst happens:
 - all storage media gets a copy of the recovery program so you can 
 recover your files to any computer straight from the backups without
 needing to reinstall the software.
 - the GUI also includes more powerful restore and recovery software.
