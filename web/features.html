            <p><span class="red">Very Simple UI</span></p>
				The UI is simple, intuitive and easy to grasp. There is comprehensive
				documentation included.

            <p><span class="red">Wizards</span></p>
            The Vault's UI provides two wizards - one to configure the backup/files and the
            other to connect to your backup drives or cloud stores.
            You can dry-run the backup to see what will be saved, or you can run a comprehansive
            test of your backup drives and cloud stores.

            <p><span class="red">Support For Many Storage Types</span></p>
            The Vault will backup to the following stores:
            <ul>
            <li>A Local Folder</li>
            <li>A USB drive</li>
            <li>A Remote Folder - which will be mounted and unmounted as required</li>
            <li>An FTP Server - with full support for SFTP encryption (enabling encryption is strongly recommended)</li>
            <li>Dropbox - you can get a free 2GB account and store your most important data "in the cloud"</li>
            <li>Amazon S3 - Nothing is more reliable.</li>
            </ul>
            More cloud storage servers are being added.

            <p><span class="red">Automatic Storage Management</span></p>
            As time goes on, your backup stores will fill up. The Vault is smart 
            enough to <i>automatically</i> remove old backups that are no longer
            required.  

            <p><span class="red">Encryption Out-Of-The-Box</span></p>
            We know that your stuff is personal and private. So we've built in 
            encryption out of the box. Simply set a Master Password, and all your 
            data stored will be encrypted. All traffic is also encrypted (with the exception of
            unencrypted FTP - which we strongly recommend you dont use).
            <br /><br />
            We use well respected, open standards for all encryption, and our implementation has been
            peer reviewed. The end result is your data is secure.
            <br /><br />
            For the geeks out there we use 
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES-256</a>, 
            selected by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology">NIST</a>
            as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standard">FIPS</a> 197
            after a long evaluation process, and now commonly used across the world. It is in 
            CBC mode with SHA256 digest used to generate a key.
            The hash is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">SHA-256</a>.
            
            <p><span class="red">Standards Based File Formats</span></p>
            All data is managed using well publicized open standards.
            Encryption uses OpenSSL libraries, data is compressed using gzip, 
            files are stored in tar format. Configuration is stored in 
            open JSON format.
            <br /><br />
            The upshot is that you can manually examine and unpack stored files
            using openssl and tar, without Vault if necessary. 
            The exact commands are provided in the manual. 

            <p><span class="red">Comprehensive Data Recovery</span></p>
            Firstly - you can simply run The Vault's UI to recover any file at
            any time. In fact, you can see all backed up files as they were
            at any time in the past - so if you want to "roll back" any change, its easy.
            <br /><br />
            But lets imagine that the worst happens and your HDD crashes, your PC explodes 
            or (shudder) your house burns down. When your new Disk/PC/House is set up,
            you have several options:
            <ul>
            <li>Reinstall The Vault - after install you can recover your backup status from 
            your backed up files. Then you can then walk through the disaster recovery 
            system inside The Vault's standard UI. You can even reinstall all your old software.</li>
            <li>Run The Disaster Recovery Program - this doesn't even require The Vault! Every
            backup storage location gets a complete disaster recovery program copied to it. Simply
            connect to the drive and run it.</li>
            <li>Use command line tools - because vault stores all data in industry standard
            formats, you can recover your data using standard command line tools (if you are so
            inclined)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><span class="red">Notifications</span></p>
            You can elect to have The Vault place a message on the desktop and/or
            email you after each backup run. The email will include details and statistics
            from the backup run. A full history can also be reviewed using the UI.

            <p><span class="red">Comprehensive Backup Options</span></p>
            You can backup different sets of files in different ways.
            For example, you could backup your important files every day (or hour!), 
            but only backup your music weekly. Music usually doesn't change much.
				<br /><br />
				You can opt to backup everything, or just changes. And you can
				include or exclude certain types of files.
				<br /><br />
				Every backup can (and probably should be) verified. That is, all the 
				data written to the remote site is re-read to ensure it was saved correctly.
				Also, the hash for each backup is saved - later corruption or malicious
				modifications will be detected.              

            <p><span class="red">Easy Scheduling</span></p>
            The Vault includes a very simple way to schedule when your backups should run.
            No more messing about with crontabs.

            <p><span class="red">Multiple Active Backups</span></p>
            The Vault allows you to define more than one backup, where a backup is a set
            of files saved to a storage location according to a set of rules.
            <br /><br />
            For example - your important files (accounts, essays, classwork)
            could be backed up to Dropbox every night.
            Your music (probably very large) could be backed up to another computer
            or a USB drive every week. You buy music only occasionally.
