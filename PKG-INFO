Description: ==================================
        The Vault Backup Management System
        ==================================
        The Vault provides a simple set-and-forget backup management system.
        
        It backups up files to a variety of media, and includes support for
        encryption out of the box, splitting, automatic media management, 
        hash validation and more. It also includes a simple to use GUI to get
        you started right away.
         
        All data is stored in industry standard TAR/GZIP compatible files, 
        and encrypted with OpenSSL encryption (AES-256). A variety of 
        disaster recovery systems are available in case the worst happens:
        - all storage media gets a copy of the recovery program so you can 
        recover your files to any computer straight from the backups without
        needing to install the software.
        - the GUI also includes more powerful restore and recovery software.
